Improve layout
--------------

- submit/clear button in one line
- button for show node ids without line break
- put an initial example in text fields
- "nicer" layout


New functionality
-----------------

- extend Icurry: add parameter "--maxsteps=<n>" so that the interpreter
  terminates after these steps
- call the interpreter with a fixed value for `maxsteps`
- extend web page to allow for setting of this value (in a range 1..100 or so)
- store some example programs in a directory (e.g., see directory
  `examples` in this repository) and provide selection button in the
  web page: if selected, put example text in program field and set `main`
  in main expression field


Installation on margaux (aka icurry.informatik.uni-kiel.de)
-----------------------------------------------------------

- provide main introction web page with some explanations
- with link to actual script page


Later
-----

- try also to use prelude operations in programs
- improve graph layout
