        This tool can be used to visualize smaller computations of the
        <a href="http://curry-lang.org/" target="_blank">Curry programming language</a>
        as a slide show.
        It was created by Sascha Ecks in the context of a bachelor's thesis
        supervised by
        <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/" target="_blank">Prof. Michael Hanus</a>
        at the <a href="https://www.uni-kiel.de" target="_blank">CAU Kiel</a>.

        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>
          Just enter a Curry program and a main expression that should
          be evaluated into the corresponding fields.
          Note that the Curry program must <em>define all functions</em>, i.e.,
          only data types but no functions from the prelude can be used.
          With the "term graph" option, the computation's
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_graph" target="_blank">term graphs</a>
         are displayed as actual graphs so that the sharing of common
         subexpression is visualized.
        </p>
        <p>
         The option "term graph as tree" displays the term graphs as trees,
         where shared nodes are displayed multiple times.
         To avoid infinitely deep tree representations of term graphs
         in case of graphs with circles, a maximum
         depth for the generated tree representations has to be specified
         if this option is selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the maximum number of execution steps is always
          limited to avoid infinite computations.
          The limit can be set manually but cannot exceed {{max_steps}} steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that Curry programs are compiled into the intermediate
          <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/Declare19_ICurry.html" target="_blank">ICurry representation</a> of programs.
          Thus, functions containing nested patterns in the left-hand sides
          of their rules are translated into simpler functions by
          introducing auxiliary operations which might occur during
          a computation.
        </p>

        <h4>Symbols used in the term graph</h4>
        <p>
          The following symbols are used in graphs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
           <em>Rectangle nodes</em> represent data constructors or literals,
           i.e., nodes which cannot be further evaluated.
          </li>
          <li>
           <em>Choice nodes</em> labelled with "?" represent
           non-deterministic choices between two expressions.
           Thus, non-deterministic computations are explicitly
           represented (in contrast to backtracking implementations).
           The number after the "?" is the unique choice identifier.
          </li>
          <li>
           <em>Yellow nodes</em> identify the node to be evaluated in the
           next step.
          </li>
          <li>
           <em>Green nodes</em> show an already computed result.
          </li>
        </ul>
